# mathOperations

For this activity you will be combining user input, console output, variables that reference String and double data types and math operations.

Getting Started  

Open up a new project in IntelliJ. Either have IntelliJ generate a Main.java file with a public static void main(String[] args) method by choosing the Command Line App template or create it yourself.

Assignment  

In the main method of Main.java class:

Ask the user to input two numbers
Get the numbers as Strings using Scanner
Convert a String to a double using Double.parseDouble. Save the the first double value in an operand1 variable and the second double value in an operand2 variable
Add the operands and save in a sum variable
Subtract the operands and save in a difference variable
Divide the operands and save in a division variable
Multiple the operands and save in a multiplication variable
Find the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save in a remainder variable. See this page if you need to learn more about the remainder operator.
Call a showResults method and pass the sum, difference, division, multiplication and remainder variables as arguments.
In the showResults method output the parameters with some meaningful text (e.g. The sum is 10.5).
